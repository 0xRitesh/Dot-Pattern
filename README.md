# About

Various websites have this effect, however it was the old processing website that truly encouraged me to do it (effect no longer). No other website, however, had the same effect as the one I designed! As a result, I made it myself :)
This was also a wonderful method to learn & practicsÂ quadtrees, which is a technique for minimising collisions between a large number of particles.

# Navigating
- Left click to change modes.
- Right click to show quadtree.
